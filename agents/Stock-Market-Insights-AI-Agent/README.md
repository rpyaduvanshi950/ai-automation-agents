## How It Works
1. **Trigger**: The workflow starts with a chat or webhook trigger where you input a stock-related query (e.g., "What's the outlook for TCS?").
2. **Extract Ticker**: An LLM node parses your message to extract the correct NSE ticker symbol.
3. **Fetch Stock Data**: The workflow queries Yahoo Finance for the latest price, volume, and technical data.
4. **Fetch News**: It retrieves the latest news headlines about the company using NewsAPI.
5. **Summarize & Analyze**: An AI node generates a structured report covering market status, news sentiment, technical signals, and recommendations.
